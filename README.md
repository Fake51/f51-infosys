Description
===========

This project is a Wordpress plugin to connect Wordpress with Infosys. More specifically, it creates a new post type - rpg activity - and allows for filling in all needed details for Infosys directly from Wordpress.

The reasoning behind the plugin is that Wordpress is a great platform to display activity details on, but having to enter details there as well as in Infosys is double work. That is exactly what this plugin attempts to eliminate.

Installing
==========

Just drop the f51-infosys folder in the Wordpress wp-content/plugins/ folder and it should be registered. Then all you need to do is activate it.
